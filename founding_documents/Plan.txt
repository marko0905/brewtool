BrewTool Project Plan

1. Goals:
- Making a terminal UI (TUI) for using homebrew
-Inspiration is lazygit
-Use JavaScript
-Use BUN
-Use ink (https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink?tab=readme-ov-file#box)

2. Core functionality:
-We will have 3 panels:
  -Search panel
  -Main panel
  -Brewfile panel
-We navigate trough the panels using 1-3
-The panels are placed vertically using (10/80/10 % + the commands bar) of the 100% of the screen in height and 100% in width.
  Or the sizes can be adjusted to this specification
  ╭─ [ 1 - SEARCH ] ───────────────╮  <-one line for the top row of the panel
  │ >                              │  <-one row for the search field
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯  <-one line for the bottom row of the panel
  ╭─ [ 2 - MAIN ] ─────────────────╮
  │ List item                      │
  │ List item                      │  <-the rest is taken by the Main panel
  │ List item                      │
  │ List item                      │
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
  ╭─ [ 3 - BREWFILE ] ─────────────╮  <-one line for the top row of the panel
  │ No brewfile                    │  <-one row for the brewfile information
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯  <-one line for the bottom row of the panel
  |Bar to show the commands        |
-When we focus on the panel the command bar changes the command list
  -So if we were on the search panel we would have:
  | |1| Search |2| Main |3| Brewfile| |enter| To start search |
-When entering the program the focus is on the first panel (Search Panel)
  -And we can start searching for the package/app
  -When we enter the name of the package/app and press enter the search starts (there needs to be enter in the 
    command bar for start search)
  -When enter is pressed to start the search the text entered in the search field needs to be removed
  -If there are packages available on homebrew the SEARCH Panel expands to show the list of packages that 
    can be installed and the main panel shrinks by the amount he search panel expands
  ╭─ [ 1 - SEARCH ] ───────────────╮
  │ >                              │
  │  package 1                     │  <- This panel expands to accommodate the list that forms
  │  package 2                     │
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
  ╭─ [ 2 - MAIN ] ─────────────────╮
  │ List item                      │  <- This panel shrinks to accommodate the Search panel expansion
  │ List item                      │ 
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
  ╭─ [ 3 - BREWFILE ] ─────────────╮
  │ No brewfile                    │
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
  |Bar to show the commands        |
  - The list in the Search panel that forms by searching for the packages/apps should look like this:
    | |*|package name|short description if available| <- The * indicates the package/app is selected / The color of the text in the line changes to green when selected
    |→| |package name|short description if available| <- The → shows where we are positioned
-When entering the program the second panel shows the list of installed programs and updates if available
-I think its ok tu run the brew update command at the start of the program but I will leave that up to you
-When switching to the Main panel we can use the arrow keys up and down to move trough the list
-We select the package/app by pressing space
  -The list will be organized like this:
  | | |Select all ↓|                         <- If this is selected all packages/apps that can be updated will be updated / set the * to all packages that can be updatedand change the color to green
  | |*|package name|version|->|new version|  <- The * indicates the package/app is selected / The color of the text in the line changes to green when selected
  | |x|package name|version|-x|-----------|  <- ----------- indicates that no update is available / Cant be selected indicated by x and the color of the text is orange
  |→|x|package name|version|-x|-----------|  <- The → shows where we are positioned
  | | |package name|version|->|new version|
-We initialize the update process by pressing U
-If a short description is needed for the installed packages I leave to you. Would be nice though. 
  -If the short description is implemented that row could be removed if the terminal screen is to small.
-We can also select packages/apps and delete them by selecting them und pressing D
-We could add the search option to the MAIN panel by pressing / to narrow the packages/apps list.
  Something like this:
  ╭─ [ 2 - MAIN ] ─────────────────╮
  │ >                              │  <- By presing / this pops up and we could enter the name of the package/app
  │ List item                   |*|│      or just the first letter or couple of letters to shrink the list
  │ List item                   |*|│      -press u to use the shrunk list and again use arrows to cycle trough the list
  │ List item                   |*|│      -press s again to go to the search bar of the MAIN panel
  │ List item                   | |│      -press x to exit search and go back to cycle trough the compleat list
  │ List item                   | |│
  │ List item                   | |│
  │ List item                   | |│
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
-If the list of installed packages is to big to fit the panel a scroll bar needs to be placed.
  ╭─ [ 2 - MAIN ] ─────────────────╮
  │ List item                   |*|│
  │ List item                   |*|│  <- the scroll bar is implemented like this using |*|
  │ List item                   |*|│      or if there is a better option let me know
  │ List item                   |*|│
  │ List item                   | |│
  │ List item                   | |│
  │ List item                   | |│
  │ List item                   | |│
  ╰────────────────────────────────╯
-When entering the program the BREWFILE panel shows the status if the brewfile is present or not.
-When focusing on the BREWFILE panel we have the options to make a brewfile from the list of installed packages/apps
-The brewfile is stored in ~/.config/brewtool/brewfile
-The user can manually copy the brewfile if he already had one to the ~/.config/brewtool/brewfile directory
  -Or symlink it from their .dotfiles
-If the player imports his brewfile then we need the option to install packages/apps from the brewfile
-We would need the option to update the brewfile if the installed packages/apps are out of sync
-Maybe if the installed packages/apps are out of sinc the color of the panel border and title should be orange or yellow
  to indicate the problem.
-When focusing on the panel the panel border and title should be green.
-Unfocused panel border and title should be white

3. Technologies
-JavaScript and BUN
-ink package
-Homebrew (as the package manager we're working with)

4. Guides
-We will not use single letter variables and functions!

5. Important
-This is a project used to learn JS and BUN
-Detailed explanation will be required
-Will implement step by step feature so no rushing with the code
-Don't give code unless asked to do so.
-We go step by step. 
-We have a problem; we get a solution for that problem.
-When adding a new file we will show the fille path and ad the *! sign next to the file to show that this is new
  Like this:
  brewtool/
  ├── main.go *!  <- The name used here is en example!
  └──founding_documents/
      ├── file_structure.txt
      └── Plan.txt
-Always give the whole code and not the snippets to add.
